	<h1>RPG Equipment Requirements</h1>
</div>

		<p>This is strictly about single-player games, and although it may
			happen in other genres, RPGs, especially &quot;diablo-like&quot; ARPGs, are
			the biggest offenders.
		</p>
</section>

	<section class="svelte-pdvyg4"><h2 class="svelte-4np2sa"><a href="#prelude" id="prelude">Prelude</a>
</h2>
		<p>I&#39;m playing &quot;unnamed ARPG&quot; and, early in the game, while progressing
			through the main quest line, I find a cave with an over-leveled
			boss. The game tells you that the boss is going to be a challenge,
			but, after mowing down hundreds of enemies, it&#39;s refreshing to have
			to try hard.
		</p>

		<p>I beat the boss and as a reward, I get a piece of equipment which is
			a clear upgrade over what I have. Unfortunately, the equipment has a
			minimum requirement of 5 levels above my current level. It is very
			likely that I just wasted my time.
		</p>
</section>

	<section class="svelte-pdvyg4"><h2 class="svelte-4np2sa"><a href="#the-problems" id="the-problems">The Problems</a>
</h2>

		<ul><li>Not getting a reward that you can immediately use feels bad. One
				could argue that in a utopic game the reward is beating the boss
				itself after understanding the mechanics and playing well. This
				ranges from very much harder than dropping a usable reward to
				impossible to do with many bosses, especially in ARPGs.
			</li>
			<li>It discourages exploration of the current area. Time is limited
				and once you understand that it is likely that every hard
				encounter will drop equipment for a higher level, it makes more
				sense to just skip to the next intended area.
			</li>
			<li>It clutters inventory space. Storing unused equipment in a
				storage box also doesn&#39;t help because comparing drops with
				current equipment requires the extra step of checking the
				storage. Often in these types of games min-maxing is encouraged
				by the developers and sought by the players, so, it should be
				made frictionless.
			</li>
			<li>I&#39;ve read that &quot;anticipation makes it so that when you can use
				the item it feels better&quot;. I largely disagree, it can happen but
				there needs to be some agency for it to work. One example that
				comes to mind is a situation in which you have a &quot;broken&quot; item
				and you have to do certain steps to fix it. It&#39;s much different
				than asking the user to grind levels.
			</li></ul>
</section>

	<section class="svelte-pdvyg4"><h2 class="svelte-4np2sa"><a href="#my-take" id="my-take">My take</a>
</h2>
		<ul><li><p>Attributes soft requirements for almost every item. It makes
					sense that I can at least wield a sword even if I have low
					strength at the cost of doing less damage, slower attack
					speed, using more stamina, or whatever penalty fits.
				</p>
				<p>There can still be weapons with more stringent requirements
					but make it fun, complex (i.e. avoid requirements like &quot;kill
					2 billion demons&quot;), and meaningful!
				</p></li>

			<li><p>Scale equipment with attributes. This fixes the problem of
					not being rewarded for early-game exploration and the need
					to have the same item with different stats. No more
					&quot;Longsword +1&quot; and &quot;Longsword +45&quot;.
				</p>

				<p>Farming for better stats on the same item, however, is fun
					for many players in such games so it should be kept in the
					game, just relegated to the end-game content.
				</p></li>

			<li>Inventory cluttering should be largely dealt with by this
				design, but, of course, inventory management is still a part of
				these types of games so it won&#39;t magically get better for
				whoever doesn&#39;t like it.
			</li>

			<li><p>Most importantly, try to do as little as possible in
					defining how a player should play the game.
				</p>
				<p>I feel like a lot of issues arise from forcing the player to
					play the game in a specific way. Embrace allowing the player
					to make choices that define how they will experience the
					game.
				</p></li></ul>
